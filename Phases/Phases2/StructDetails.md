Absolutely, Santosh — let’s do a **deep dive into each folder and file** in this upgraded Phase 2 backend structure. I’ll explain **what each folder is for, what files it should hold, and how it works** in the overall system. This will give you a clear blueprint before we start coding.

---

## **1️⃣ Root Folder: `backend/`**

This is the root of your Django project.

* **Purpose:** Houses all apps, common utilities, config, scripts, and project-wide files.
* **Key files/folders:**

  * `manage.py` → Django CLI entry point.
  * `requirements.txt` → Python dependencies.
  * `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` → Containerization and services.
  * `.gitignore` → Ignore unnecessary files in Git.
  * `apps/` → All domain apps (auth, billing, inventory, etc.).
  * `common/` → Shared utilities and base code.
  * `config/` → Project-wide settings, URLs, WSGI/ASGI, Celery.
  * `scripts/` → Seeders, migrations, batch jobs.
  * `tests/` → Global test helpers (optional).

**How it works:** Everything runs from `manage.py` and imports apps/modules from `apps/` and `common/`.

---

## **2️⃣ Apps Folder: `apps/`**

Each app is **modular** and focused on a single business domain. Example apps: `auth`, `billing`, `inventory`, `expenses`, `reports`, `notifications`, `business_settings`.

**Structure of a typical app:**

```
apps/<app_name>/
├── migrations/
│   └── __init__.py
├── models/            # Model definitions (split by domain entities)
├── serializers/       # DRF serializers for API
├── views/             # ViewSets / API endpoints
├── urls.py            # App-specific URL router
├── permissions.py     # Custom permissions for this app
├── utils.py           # App-specific utility functions
├── tests/             # App-specific test cases
├── __init__.py
├── admin.py
└── apps.py
```

**How it works:**

* `models/` → Defines your database tables for the app (use `BusinessScopedModel` + `TimeStampedModel`).
* `serializers/` → Converts models to JSON and validates inputs.
* `views/` → Handles API requests; uses DRF ViewSets or APIViews.
* `permissions.py` → Role-based access (Admin, Manager, Staff) and object-level checks.
* `urls.py` → Routes app URLs to views.
* `tests/` → Unit and API tests to ensure app behaves correctly.

**Example:** `apps/auth/`

* `models/user.py` → User model.
* `models/membership.py` → Membership linking users to businesses + role.
* `serializers/user.py` → Serialize user data for API.
* `views/auth_views.py` → Login, logout, current user endpoint.
* `permissions.py` → IsAdmin, IsManager, etc.

---

## **3️⃣ Common Folder: `common/`**

**Purpose:** Centralized utilities and base classes shared across all apps.

**Structure:**

```
common/
├── models.py           # Base models & mixins (TimeStampedModel, SoftDeleteMixin, BusinessScopedModel)
├── permissions.py      # Generic permissions (IsAdmin, IsBusinessMember)
├── filters.py          # Search, date range filters
├── pagination.py       # Default pagination class
├── enums.py            # InvoiceStatus, PaymentMethod, Currency, etc.
├── exceptions.py       # Standardized API error responses
├── middleware.py       # Tenant resolution (X-Business-ID → request.business)
├── utils.py            # Generic helper functions
├── validators.py       # Custom validators (e.g., positive amounts)
└── __init__.py
```

**How it works:**

* All apps import from `common` instead of duplicating code.
* Example: Every app can inherit `BusinessScopedModel` to ensure queries are automatically filtered by `request.business`.
* Middleware automatically sets `request.business` for multitenancy.
* `exceptions.py` ensures every error response has a standardized format.

---

## **4️⃣ Config Folder: `config/`**

**Purpose:** Project-wide configuration, settings, entry points, and URL routing.

**Structure:**

```
config/
├── settings/
│   ├── base.py         # Common settings (installed apps, middleware, database config)
│   ├── dev.py          # Development-specific overrides
│   └── prod.py         # Production-specific overrides
├── urls.py             # Root URL router (includes app routers)
├── wsgi.py             # WSGI entry point
├── asgi.py             # ASGI entry point (websockets, async)
├── celery.py           # Celery config for background tasks
└── __init__.py
```

**How it works:**

* `settings/base.py` has all shared settings.
* Environment-specific settings (`dev.py`, `prod.py`) import from base and override as needed.
* `urls.py` includes all apps under `/api/v2/`.
* `celery.py` sets up Celery for async jobs like email invoices, low-stock notifications.

---

## **5️⃣ Scripts Folder: `scripts/`**

**Purpose:** Helper scripts for data migration, seeding, batch processing.

**Examples:**

* `seed_business.py` → Create default businesses and business types.
* `migrate_phase1_to_phase2.py` → Migrate old models to new Phase 2 structure.

**How it works:** Run scripts manually via `python scripts/seed_business.py` or integrate into CI/CD pipelines.

---

## **6️⃣ Tests Folder: `tests/` (Global Helpers)**

**Purpose:** Shared test factories and helper functions.

**Examples:**

* `factories.py` → `factory_boy` factories for users, products, invoices.
* `conftest.py` → Pytest fixtures (e.g., creating a business context automatically).

**How it works:**

* Each app has its own `tests/` for unit tests.
* Global `tests/` holds reusable factories and fixtures.

---

## **7️⃣ Docker + Deployment**

**Purpose:** Containerized environment for web + worker + database + redis.

* `Dockerfile` → Builds web container with Python, Django, dependencies.
* `docker-compose.yml` → Defines services: `web`, `worker`, `redis`, `postgres`.
* `config/celery.py` → Connects Celery worker to Redis broker.

**How it works:**

* Run `docker-compose up` → All services start.
* Django app + Celery worker + Redis + Postgres all communicate seamlessly.

---

## **8️⃣ Multitenancy Integration Across Folders**

* `common/middleware.py` → Resolves `request.business` from `X-Business-ID`.
* `common/models.py` → Base models filter by business.
* All apps’ `views/` → Use `get_queryset()` with `.filter(business=request.business)`.
* `permissions.py` → Enforce that users cannot access other businesses’ data.
